    	<h1>3D Sketch</h1><br>
    	<p>I trying to make a object that shows how in the Japanese culture I feel about cute culture and how being out side Japan, I have been reseving the lebel from people and from articlues</p>
    	<p>I specificly chose a material that is easily broken because I felt like some of the article did actuly hurt me since the author who didn't grow up in Japan didn't do enough research and said that something I have been believing is totally wrong and only shows the sicking part of the humanity.</p>
    	<p>inside there is a figure of person putting up the poster looking words which represent what I believe cute culture could be and how it stands for me</p>
    	<p>many of things inside are covered in gulitter with represent that estetic of cuteness people see</p>
    	<p>From the out side there are black and white lebel with words that shows how cute culture are studied outside the Japanese culture which make the viwer hard to seek though those word on the outside</p>
